# Thinkfulbnb

## Introduction

Thinkfulbnb is a mock vacation rental website inspired by platforms like Airbnb and OkCupid. It showcases a static frontend implementation with responsive design, adapting seamlessly from mobile to desktop views. The project emphasizes modern CSS layout techniques including Flexbox. Visit the live website [here](https://loganprit.github.io/thinkfulbnb/).

Flexbox was instrumental in building a fluid layout that responds to various screen sizes. By leveraging Flexbox's alignment, direction, order, and size capabilities, I created an intuitive and appealing user experience.
